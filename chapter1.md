# Introduction

## Functional vs. Imperative Data Structures

- "First, from the point of view of designing and implementing efficient data structures, functional programming's stricture against destructive updates (i.e., assignments) is a staggering handicap, tantamount to confiscating a master chef's knives. Like knives, destructive updates can be dangerous when misused, but tremendously effective when used properly." (p.2)
  
- *persistent* data structure - supports multiple versions

    *ephemeral* - allows only a single version at a time
